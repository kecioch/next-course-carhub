# Build and Deploy a Modern Next.js 13 Application | React, Next JS 13, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

## by JavaScript Mastery

This project was my second touch with NextJS. It is based on the video course from JavaScriptMastery. 

The Application provides the user the opportunity to search and filter for rentable cars. The project was a good opportunity to test out the server-side-rendering functionalities of NextJS.
